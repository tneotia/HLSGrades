## FAQs

1) I can't login to the app

Make sure you're using the correct email and password, and that you have selected the correct institution. If you are receiving any error messages when logging in, please send a message to the address above to have the issue resolved.

2) The app isn't loading

Check your internet connection. In rare cases, an uninstall and reinstall might be needed to fix the issue. If you're getting an error screen, please send a message to the address above.

3) I can't logout, it gives me an error

I am working on a patch for this issue. If this has happened to you, try one of two things:

a) Uninstall and reinstall the app

b) Clear app data (Android only) - Long press the app icon on the home screen, press "app info" (in some cases this is just an info icon), scroll to "storage" and tap it, then tap "clear data". Reopen the app and it should have reset without needing an uninstall and reinstall.

**For any other issues, please message the address above to have the issue resolved.**

Thanks!
