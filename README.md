# HLS Grades
Custom app to view self-hosted Canvas LMS grades on iOS and Android. 

As you may know, the official Canvas suite of apps is not available for self-hosted instances. Enter HLS Grades, which is 95% native on both Android and iOS, only using the web version of Canvas for a few functions. It has the same feature set as the official Canvas Student/Parent/Teacher apps, except it isn't split into three separate apps. I'm constantly adding fixes, improvements, and new features as well! 

Plus, it's coded in Google's Flutter, which means you get two apps for the price of one, and I'll also provide maintenance.

Check out the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thelatinschool.canvasgrades) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1526225557) - it has amassed 750+ downloads across the 1 K-12 and 10+ Higher-ed institutions that currently use it, with a perfect 5.0 star rating!

### Screenshots:

Here's what you can expect the app to look like for your users:
